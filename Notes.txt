JDBC notes -
recap -
mysql connector java is the dependency we added

we need 3 things to work with DB
1. address of DB - url
2. Name of DB
3. Credentials: Username, password

Connection class - to establish the connection with DB
make a statement - it allows us to send the query to the DB
Resultset - the result will be stored in its object

rset.next() - to shift the cursor on to the next line/row

ResultSetmetadata - it contains the information about the result such as how many columns are there
                    how many rows, name of columns/rows etc.

 To integrate with framework, we will pass url, username and password in confg.prop file

 In order to itegrate our db in framework, we create DBUtility class
